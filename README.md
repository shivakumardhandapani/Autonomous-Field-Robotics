Autonomous Field Robotics
This repository contains a collection of projects and simulations developed for the study and application of autonomous field robotics. Each project is organized into its own directory, providing resources and code to explore various aspects of robotics, including 3D reprojection, image mapping, mosaicing, and environmental simulation.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

3d Reprojection/: Contains code and resources for 3D reprojection techniques.
Image Mapping and Panaroma/: Includes scripts and data for image mapping and panorama creation.
Image Mosaicing - Roman Shipwreck/: Focuses on image mosaicing, specifically applied to a Roman shipwreck dataset.
Simple General Purpose Weather Simulator using Transition Matrix/: Offers a simple weather simulation model utilizing a transition matrix approach.
Project Details
3D Reprojection
This project explores 3D reprojection methods, providing tools to project 3D points onto 2D planes and vice versa. It includes sample data and visualization scripts to aid in understanding the reprojection process.

Image Mapping and Panorama
In this project, techniques for image mapping and panorama stitching are implemented. The provided scripts allow for the transformation of image perspectives and the creation of wide-field panoramas from multiple images.

Image Mosaicing - Roman Shipwreck
Focusing on a dataset of a Roman shipwreck, this project demonstrates image mosaicing techniques. The goal is to create a cohesive mosaic image from a series of photographs, which is particularly useful in archaeological documentation.

Simple General Purpose Weather Simulator using Transition Matrix
This project presents a basic weather simulation model based on a transition matrix. It simulates weather patterns over time, providing a foundation for more complex environmental simulations in robotic applications.
